# Provenance

This project is human-directed and AI-assisted. Final design authority,
acceptance criteria, and editorial control rest with the human author.
AI contributions were material and are categorized below by function.

## Human authorship

The author defined the project direction, requirements, and design intent.
AI systems contributed proposals, drafts, implementation, and critique under
author supervision; they did not independently determine project goals or
deployment decisions. The author reviewed, revised, or rejected AI-generated
output throughout development.

## AI-assisted collaboration

### Architectural design and constraint model

Lead collaboration: ChatGPT (OpenAI). Drove the courier framing (demoting the
earlier "witnesser" posture to a courier with custody-not-standing), the
slice roadmap and scope-control shape, and the decision to treat `record.json`
as a durable contract rather than incidental CLI output.

### Design documentation and constraint enforcement

Lead collaboration: Claude (Anthropic) via Claude Code. Authored the design
record (`DESIGN.md`), the historical design input (`CANDIDATE.md`), grounded
the design against the pre-existing manual substrate-run toolkit, and policed
the boundary (no domain verdicts, no caller vocabulary, refusal-not-fabrication).

### Slice 1 implementation

Lead collaboration: Codex (OpenAI). Initial implementation of the SSH courier
slice — `porterlib` (CLI, record writer, runner, SSH transport), the
Porter-neutral exit-code sentinel, and the run-record scaffolding.

## Provenance basis and limits

This document is a functional attribution record based on commit history,
co-author trailers (where present), project notes, and documented working
sessions. It is not a complete forensic account of all contributions.

Some AI contributions (especially design critique, rejected alternatives,
and footguns avoided) may not appear in repository artifacts or commit
metadata.

Model names/tools are recorded at the platform level (e.g., ChatGPT,
Claude Code, Codex); exact model versions may vary across sessions and are not
exhaustively reconstructed here.

## What this document does not claim

- No exact proportional attribution. Contributions are categorized by
  function, not quantified by token count or lines of code.
- Design and implementation were not cleanly sequential. Architecture
  informed code, code revealed design gaps, and the feedback loop was
  continuous.
- "Footguns avoided" and "ideas that didn't ship" are real contributions
  that leave no artifact. This document cannot fully account for them.
